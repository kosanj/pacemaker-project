# Pacemaker Simulation Project

This project involved simulating a **rate-adaptive pacemaker** on the **FRDM-K64F hardware**.

The four core pacing modes **(AOO, VOO, AAI, and VVI)** were enhanced to adjust the cardiac cycle based on **metabolic need**, measured using an **accelerometer**. This produced four new rate-adaptive modes: **AOOR, VOOR, AAIR, and VVIR**.
